Useful definitions 
==================

Waypoint path defines a connection between 2 waypoints. Current path is a path from current waypoint (nearest one, use 'botrix waypoint reset' command to reset) to waypoint destination (use 'botrix waypoint destination' command to set or just aim at waypoint to set destination).

Items are objects on the map, such as weapons, bullets, health-kits, armor, buttons, doors, boxes, etc. They are defined in the MOD's configuration file.
