* Botrix was created as a thesis for an academic degree. Thanks a lot to my 
  thesis director to give me a chance to make something I like.

* Plugin's grandfather is Botman's bot template (aka HPB_bot). Thanks grandpa!

* Plugin is working on Team Fortress 2 because of HappoKala345 (aka AcidFish)
  request. It also works with VSH plugin, for which manual weapon handling was 
  added.
  Many of HappoKala's ideas were used, thanks a lot for waypoints creation, TF2
  weapons configuration for bots and testing!
  HappoKala created waypoints for next TF2 maps:
    - arena_granary
    - arena_lumberyard
    - arena_offblast_final
    - arena_pool_day
    - arena_sawmill
    - arena_well
    - koth_deku
    - vsh_warebloom_b7
